## About The Project

<p> In this project, I created a simple influenza calculator. There are three stage - safe, alert and warning. According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/cruise/reporting-deaths-illness/how-calculate-influenza-influenza-like-illness-case-outbreak-threshold-cumulative-reports.html"><span>Influenza outbreak equation from CDC report</span></a>, by entering total population, total active cases and activeness, you can predict the level of risk.</p>
